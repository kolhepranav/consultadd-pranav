Alright, so I need to extract only the mandatory eligibility criteria from this RFP text. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire content carefully to identify sections that mention requirements which candidates must meet. The user specified criteria like experience, registrations, certifications, turnover, location, etc., so I should look for those terms or implied mandatory points.

Looking at section 7.1: It talks about compliance with immigration laws and E-Verify system. So, this includes E-Verify enrollment, Maintain Company page screenshot, and providing proof of enrollment upon request. These are mandatory requirements, so they should be included.

Next, in section 7.3: Invoices must be submitted to MHMR’s Accounts Payable Department or mailed with a specific PO box. There's also mention of discounts but not acceptance of payment terms shorter than 30 days. So the submission method is a key requirement here; thus, it's mandatory.

Section 7.4 mentions obtaining applicable permits from local, state, county, and federal authorities. This is about compliance with regulations, so it's a necessary criterion.

In section 7.6: Historically Under-Utilized Business (HUB) requirements include submitting a proof of HUB certificate or stating intentions to subcontract if not certified. So this is another mandatory point as it affects how they approach the project.

Section 7.7 discusses Minority/Women and/or Disadvantaged Businesses (M/W/DBE), requiring submissions of their certificates, which is an additional requirement for inclusivity but still part of eligibility.

Section 8 talks about insurance requirements: workers' compensation, employer liability, comprehensive commercial general liability, automobile liability, and contractual liability. All these must be maintained throughout the contract period as per MHMR's policies.

Additionally, section 8.1 specifically mentions that the awarded company must submit a certificate of insurance to the Purchasing Director at a specific address. This is another mandatory point regarding documentation.

I need to make sure I'm only including strict compliance items—so each of these points (E-Verify, payment methods, permits, HUB/M/W/DBE certifications, and insurance details) are clear requirements that must be met without exception.

Now, considering the output format: a valid JSON with clear key-value pairs. So for each criterion, I'll create an object where the key is the requirement name (like E-Verify Enrollment), and the value is the specifics of the requirement as stated in the text.

I should avoid any explanations or surrounding text, just the key-value pairs.
